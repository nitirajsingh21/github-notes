it is a Version control system, also known as source control , 
is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.

git is software for version control system
three types
local: local version control system(we are managing everything in our local machine)
centralised: every user connected from system and everyone access from this system(if this system
fails then we lose system files)and in this there is a deadlock condition(time taken to complete one process until
second one comes
(spof):single point of failure
distributed:control system working on multiple devices and
have acces to multiple user and it is a unique and have a collabrative environment

git is a distributed control version system
git manages our codes and files

working directory(git addcommand)---->staging area(temporary locaton where we manages our files/git commit)------->git repository.git(folder which saves our file information)

metadata(data about data)

ls -a( to show hidden file)
we make this puting . in front of 
file
to delete : rm .data.txt

folder manage by git: git init

git status:show us which file tracked by git

git config --global user.name ""(for giving username who acces our file)
for 2) user.email
git config --list(to check the author of file)

git commit(for insertion)git stat

git log(to check the status of file)
commit value is always unique

github : hosting platform jahan pr online aap apni file manage karte h but using git
git : software jo files ko manage karega 
this saved in local machine now we want to save on platform
ex:
laptop:github
hdd: git

after commit we go in github and we create a new repository and copy three line in git
git commit -m "xyz file added"

head (current port)

git push (for commit file in github)
to set our folder upstream(git push â€“set-upstream)
git diff(for comparison of staging area and working area repository)

git mv old new file sudo shutdown -c
git cp
git rm

branches,comparing file,gitpull,fetch,stashing,git tag

Assignment:
Q) data.txt file in user
kabhi koi user bane then data.txt already assign ho jaye
/etc/skel

Q) my system shut down in every 5 minutes
 sudo shutdown -c
sudo shutdown --halt +5




day2 :
git diff filename:git l
we get to know comparison in file values 

BRANCH 
------
------

branch (it is used to copy our main repository)
to make branch-git branch branchname
to switch branch(git checkout branchname)
to merge the changes in main branch(git merge branch name)

git clone(it is used to take our file from remote repo to local repo)  
git fetch command is used to check the difference between remote repo and local repo
git pull comand is used to pull the changes from remote repo to local repo

	Git:
version control system tools that helps to track changes in code.
git is  a version control system.
it is popular free and open source
it is fast and scalable
1)to track the history
2)collaborate
configuring git
---------------
git configuring:
git config--global user.name"My Name"
git config--global user.email"someone@email.com"
git config --list

credential helper store our user name and mail
`=tell us that we are in root directory
--------------
clone and status:
local(files on pc or laptop)
remote(file on github)
clone:cloning a repository on our local machine
git clone<project lin>
forcefully hidden files show:Get-ChildItem -Force
git status
:display the status of the code.
----
after git status we got 4 thing
->untracked:new files that git doesn't yet track
->modified:changed
->staged:file is ready to be commited
->unmodified->unchanged
------------
working directory(git addcommand)---->staging area(temporary locaton where we manages our files/git commit)------->git repository.git(folder which saves our file information)
git add (add new or changed file in your working directory to the git staging area)
git add (filename)
git restore to staged file to unstage
git add.(to add all files)
git commit :it is record of change
git commit -m"some message"
push command :to upload local repo to remote repo.
git push origin main
------
origin:default repo
main(branch)
here from remote repo we select default repo (which have info about project change)
----------
first we make our folder git repo then we upload on github

git init 
git remote add origin<link>
git remote -v(to verify remote)
git branch(branch is like different fields work on one branch)
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
u(to set upstream to upload code on that main branch so we cannot write again and again)

GITHUB:
website that allows developers to store and manage their code using git. 
repository(folder where our work store
github save our changes
